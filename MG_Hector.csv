Review
"From whatever little information is available about KIA's SP Concept and MG's Hector, it appears as if they are, at least for now, targeting two different segments. The SP Concept is going to compete with Creta while the Hector, at least on paper seems like it will go up against the XUV 500/Hexa etc. Although, please bear in mind that this is purely speculation conjured up by looking at available images etc on the internet."
"However, this is a Chinese brand and they will have to work a lot to make the brand imag"
I doubt the future of MG in India with their rebadged Chinese vehicles.
"However, from what I've read so far, the Baojun 530 (which is what the Hector is called in China) is targeted towards the low end of the Chinese market and suffers from irritating creaks and groans suggesting a lack of sophistication. I hope MG addresses these before launching in India."
"MG Hector petrol engine details revealed, seem to be under-powered compared to its competition."
"Look at the torque figures. That would more than make up for the slight lesser horses. Should be quicker to the ton compared to Tucson and CR-V 
"
This one is a definite Creta rival. 2019 seems to be a busy year!
"14-118 hp and 150 Nm of torque but with a 4-speed AT, as I expected. If this ZS gets launched in the Ecosport price bracket, with the dimensions and torque/power per kg figures comparable to that of Creta, I see a great potential here.

The GS could take on the Compass as well. The brand is unknown to many and the after sale support/network needs to be seen as well; hence undercutting both the Creta and the Compass might seem sensible"
The MG 3 looks uncannily similar to the Santro from the rear. Even the tailight elements are very similar save for the shape of them.
Quality and fit and finish are superb and are easily way better than Hyundai or a Honda
MG Hector petrol engine specifications revealed. 1.5 litre turbo petrol engine which produces 145hp and 250 NM of torque mated to a six speed MT or a six speed DCT.
"Odd!! It seems odd when a company which wants to launch its cars in India pretty soon, and are actually in the middle of opening showrooms, is displaying cars which are LHD and have the variants mentioned in Mandrin at the back. I feel that this is a wrong step at the moment when China is not “really favored” nation with our country. I do not have anything against the chinese products, but one wrong move, and our folks will go like-‘ China ka maal hai, aur kitna chalega’ "
"I think the Hector is not going to come with lumbar support, damn how hard is it to put in lumbar support? They should have it at least for the driver seat. Not sure if this video was shared before. Check it out"
The rear of the MG3 resembles the second generation Punto!
I somehow have a feeling that the MG will be successful just like the OnePlus or Xiomi phones. British legacy will help it further.
"Ford, VW and Skoda struggle with less than 3-5% of market share after spending decades in the country.Also, the Chinese phone manufacturers you mention purely played the value game. Prima facia, they offered flagship kind of specs at lower value. At least that was their starting point. And obviously they indulged in heavy marketing blitz.I would not think MG is trying to be so disruptive. And there is a huge difference between a customer putting down his money for a 10-30k phone vs a 10-20 lakh car.Not saying that MG cannot succeed, but the odds are heavily stacked against it. At least as of now. MG could probably end up being a niche brand, but their product should have an USP to be niche.motorworks is offline   "
"There is no legacy beyond the badge. Chevrolet was all Korean similarly MG is all chinese in this case.SAIC have no alternative, Chinese vehicles have a poor brand perception over here, however good they are!"
"Thanks for posting these first hand images. These are China specific variants, but in China the RX5 is Roewe RX5 not MG, from the same SAIC (Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation) though. Do you have any image of its front or dash?"
"No offence meant but this car is months away from launch and we are worried about it not having lumbar support?The focus should be on engine, gearbox, size, the MG brand etc.Lumbar support is hardly a deciding factor and most cars in this bracket don't have it anyways."
Lumbar support is hardly a deciding factor and most cars in this bracket don't have it anyways.
"No offence meant but we already know what engine, gearbox, size, etc.
Lumbar support might not be a deciding factor, but since I have 2 lumbar disc bulges it helps on long drives, of course even if it came with lumbar support but doesnt drive the way I like, I'm not buying. My Chevrolet Optra which is in the lower bracket has lumbar support (manual adjust) and my old gen Tucson which is in the same bracket also has it. The new tucson, the jeep compass which fall in the same bracket also has lumbar support (electric adjust) I am sure there are cars below this bracket which offers lumbar support with manual adjustment.Drove the Tucson loved it, but its pricy. I find the compass too compact. So waiting for this one."
"While it may not be a deal breaker, I don’t understand why it should be difficult for what is slated to be a premium offering. Heck my 2009 Vista has a two stage Lumbar support. In fact it is one of those things that really helps find a comfortable position on long drives."
"Just saw the Hector at a product clinic. Great fit and finish. Worthy competitor. Panoramic sunroof, huge touchscreen, reasonable door thud. Let's see how the public responds."
"Ok I have to ask, what is a product clinic  I am waiting for the hector but leaning towards the Tucson."
"So MG is trying to pull off a Compass rather than a Creta. For the brand MG is, Hector will be a tough sell at these prices. Just an opinion based on my understanding of current market dynamics. Will be happy if Hector achieves traction at such prices."
his has been in heir site for more than a month now . It is only their expectation and not official pricing. There are many inconsistencies in pricing of different models one of which you have rightly pointed out
"On the question MG versus Tata, I guess post launch prices and real world reviews will tell the whole story. It's still early days to comment if Hector can actually upset the Harrier's sales.
MG has to do a OnePlus to awe and upset the market. Being a Vivo, Oppo versus a Samsung will be pointless."
A great pricing by MG. It sets the cat among this segment with killer pricing and fully loaded features along with bling factor. Kia has its work cut out now after such an aggressive move by MG. The unlimited 5 year warranty offered by them reposts the faith they have in their engineering and the customer satisfaction they want to achieve. The first to take hit from MG would be Compass followed by Harrier. What value Jeep brings over the hector now apart from the 4x4 models which is priced way steep and belong to the segment above. Good job MG hope you keep your full commitment to Indian market for long times to come.
"Kya baat!!Kya baat!!Kya baat!!
MG deserves a standing ovation for what it’s set to bring forward in the Indian automobile industry- ‘A revolution’. When has it been that a car is launched with nearly 75% of the TBHP members admiring the competitive price point its launched at. Just not that, IMO, MG has actually hit the nail on the head by understanding the pulse of the ‘mango people’ by giving the creature features like panoramic sunroof, voice control features, large touchscreen et all. How many of the masses get into the refinement or performance part of the vehicle. We are talking about a country where there are hardly enough roads to test the top speed handling of a vehicle. Therefore if we consider that the automobiles these days are more for a point A to point B commute, then MG will definitely reap the benefits for making that commute a feature laden and comfortable one. If I talk about my choice, I was waiting for a mid size pseudo suv with a panoramic sunroof, voice control and connect ability feature and most importantly a diesel AT. Except for the last, MG Hector ticks all the other boxes. So I think it deserves a thorough test drive and contemplation over a weekend or two and maybe also think about the petrol DCT option considering the price difference of petrol/diesel these days.
I also feel that this is a step in the right direction for our industry as it will make other manufacturers pay attention towards providing more feature rich Car'"
"Well, I test drove and booked Hector a week ago and here's what I found:
Pros:Solid metal all around, doors heavier than Skoda
Hybrid engine is breeze to drive in city condition, 48v battery is a boon in city traffic. I picked up car in 3 gear at 900rpm
Comfortable front seats with enough bolstering
Voice commands better than what I was expecting
Appropriate dimensions IMO, Harrier was too wide for my liking.
Powerful AC
Commanding driving position
Total VFM considering price and features
Steering was extremely light at crawling speed
Body roll is well maintained for it's size
Great NVH levels on Petrol
Extremely smooth gearbox
Cons:Test car had uneven panel gaps. Though, showroom guy said it'll be fixed in final version
Need to check if steering weights up at highway speed
Hard Plastic on dashboard was very cheap, so was the leather on steering
A little jittery clutch on dieselTo conclude, the car is not meant for an enthusiast but for comfortable driving.if you are looking for everyday office drive and eventual highway drives then petrol hybrid is the car for you "
I also feel that this is a step in the right direction for our industry as it will make other manufacturers pay attention towards providing more feature rich Car's 
"Slowly and surely, automobiles are becoming appliances, pure and simple. I know that 99% of the market will not care, but us remaining 1% will"

When i test drove Venue DCT, it was showing 6.9 kmpl driven for 1700 kms in Bangalore Venue claims 18kmpl. So i guess your prediction is correct..
"
"Despite the shortcomings that a Petrol AT offers, especially FE the sheer demand of nearly a full-size petrol DCT SUV is completely unprecedented, something that MG also failed to read with their extensive market-study.They would have thought that in a 'kitna deti hai' country people may still not go as hard after a petrol auto and therefore made do with a launch which due to many reasons (homologation, etc) they were fine to go slow/delay slightly the DCT. Similar was the case with the pre-delivery first batch that they decided, which has resulted in a long wait for the DCT.
I can stand testament to this, as I had booked the car (Sharp - silver/grey) within hours of bookings being open and have now been given an estimate of mid-august delivery  To counter this I have even tried and managed to speak with MG & Dealer, but afraid no change right now. I do hope though they still manage to surprise me 

I am also very keen to try and determine the FE for Petrol DCT. Contrary to someone a few posts below, MG did bring the car for a home TD but, I forgot to reset the trip. I have requested now for another night Home TD, where I have a list of things that I want to try/test which I missed the first time in the excitement. So will soon update on the same."
"There's always a massive difference between whats ARAI claimed and the actual figure.
Given the Hector's size and a turbo petrol mated to DCT, I wont expect it giving more than 10 or max 12kpl in real life city bumper to bumper driving conditions."
"I would not expect the Hector 1.4 DCT to give a mileage of more than 6.5-7.5 Kmpl in city use and maybe an 8.5 kmpl in mixed use. The Jeep Compass also in Petrol Automatic (which a friend of mine has) guise gives a mileage of 7 kmpl in city use and the engine in that is also similar and I guess the kerb weight of the Hector would be in the same ballpark. I am also part of the Jeep Delhi NCR group and there are 40+ Petrol Automatic owners who are always crying about the low mileage of 6.5-7.5 which they get! Thankfully us Diesel Jeep Compass owners are better off with around 13.5 kmpl)
Petrol Automatics have a reputation for being low mileage. I remember my own Honda Civic 1.8 AT which used to give a mileage of 6.6kmpl ! (the Civic was eventually replaced by the Laura MT Diesel, which consistently gives a mileage of 17-18kmpl in mixed use and as high as even 25 on Highways)
I wish that the new car companies offer some good Diesel AT combo, which can deliver real world mileage of 15+ Kmpl. There are a lot of good engines available with Hyundai , Skoda and VW which already deliver this, but why cant they plonk the same in a mini SUV form factor and offer it here!"
"Is this confirmed? If they have 5 free services, that would mean no labor charges for the 1 month inspection and 4 annual services. That is quite good."
"Took a test drive of the Petrol DCT. Went to Gurgaon MGF showroom right in the morning today, but had to wait for a while for the TD. Wait time is quite understandable, given the popularity. Request fellow TBHPians to call and book for TD before proceeding to the showrooms.
."
"So the 4.9 kmpl that I saw has been confirmed by others as well. In reality, anything around 9-10 should be acceptable in city runs and 13-14 in highway runs."
"I had the opportunity to take a test drive on Monday at the JP Nagar showroom. Since I went in the afternoon on a weekday, getting the test drive was effortless and I had to wait hardly 10 minutes. Did a test drive of the Petrol DCT first and then the Diesel. The Diesel felt the better of the two in terms of the power delivery for a vehicle of this size.

I loved the gizmos, especially the 360 degree camera. It proved to be very useful as I had to negotiate some inching traffic during the test drive. Drove over speed breakers and felt the suspension handled it well.
Overall feels like a good vehicle for the price. As everyone has called out the metal guage used is thick and the doors need an effort due to the thick build quality. Reminded me of the XUV 500 in this aspect.
The Vehicle is good looking from most angles. I saw it in Red, White and Grey and all colors looked good with Red looking the best in my view.
The Audio Playback from the Head Unit is good. The demo was provided of the voice control features but as most people have already spoken about it I wont elaborate much on it. I guess these type of voice commands will soon become standard even in lower segments.
Contrary to what some people have said, the Sales guy did not have a brochure and he said he will email me the details."
